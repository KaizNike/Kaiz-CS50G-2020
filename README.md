My public repo for all the projects I work on during CS50G. Enjoy!

# Important!
As of now, all games need you to use Love2D (https://love2d.org/) to play. Easiest way is to download version 10.2 and drag the game's folder into the shortcut for Love2D. Optionally, use Love2D from the command line to open. Sorry that its currently not more accessible.
